    <p>Coin Collector is my first Pygame game.</p>
    <p>Game was very simple. All what you need is collect many coins as you can.</p>
    <p>I see that is not popular because simplicity.</p>
    <p>To me, it's look more like tech demo that true game. But this is big step forwarrd because I learned Python and Pygame.</p>
