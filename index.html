    <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
    <p>I'm an indie developer. My nickname is Petrixx1. At first, my name was going to be Petrix.</p> 
    <p>But because scratch and itch.io (more on that later) wouldn't let me call myself Petrix,</p>
    <p>they offered me the name "Petrixx1" and I accepted that. My first steps were in Scratch.</p>
    <p>I found out about itch.io when I was looking for a new</p> 
    <p>platform where I could put my 2 games: Star-rise and Flappy Submarine.</p> 
    <p>They were made in Scratch. I'm not making only games.</p>
    <p>I am making also comics, but I am still not publishing any my comics.</p>
